# wsd project
Project for the course web software development CS-C3170, fall 2020. See docs.md for more info.

This is sadly the only solo-project that is somewhat recent that I can share. I rarely program on my free time, so all of the projects I have are related to either school or work. This is not really due to lack of interest in programming, just lack of time and ideas. This particular program is somewhat rushed, since the time I given to complete the project during the course was less than 2 weeks (But I did still get full points). Think of this project only as a kind of a proof of the fact that I have prior programming experience. This project was initially created in fall of 2020, and this repo is a copy of the original.
